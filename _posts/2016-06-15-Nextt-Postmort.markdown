1. Practice makes perfect. That’s what they all say. Try your best and don’t get hung up on the result. Sometimes you have done way better than ever before but you could still fail. Well, at least you got that high, didn’t you?


2. Do no over-design your MVP. Listen to your customers ahead of time rather than fixing afterwards. But don’t push user too hard so that they tell you what you want to hear.


3. “Good software engineers are extremely resistant to work from other engineers’ code.” I don’t agree with the original post in this sense. Leave the code better than you found it has always been on of my goals.


4. Releasing early minimum viable products allow you to truly test the assumptions you have about customer behavior, and iterate accordingly.


5. Talk the talk, walk the walk.
